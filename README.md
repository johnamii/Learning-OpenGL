# Learning-OpenGL

I did this project to teach myself the fundamentals of OpenGL and enable myself to work on more complicated projects that use a graphics library.

Circle Example is a basic moving circle I made from a tutorial on the internet.

Wave Motion was my attempt at simulating particle motion within an ocean surface wave.

polyrhythm was my attempt at visualizing a 6-5-4-3-2-1 polyrhythm using a series of connected rotating clocks. I still want to update it with sound and more visuals.
